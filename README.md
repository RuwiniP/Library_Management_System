# LibraryManagementSystem
Project Description

The Library Management Application is designed to be a user-friendly tool for librarians and 
students. This program is made to keep track of all the goings-on in the library. 
The goals for this program are:
• Effortless Check-Out Process: Enable a swift and simple system for borrowing books.
• Book Tracking: Observe which books are being taken out by library patrons.
• Accessible Inventory: Provide a large, user-friendly database for searching the library’s 
collection of books.
